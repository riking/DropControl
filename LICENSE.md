## For ItemStringInterpreter.java
For the licensing of ItemStringInterpreter.java, see [LGPL.md](LGPL.md).

The reason for this is that I want others to be free to use and adapt the code in that file regardless of the license that they choose for that plugin. However, I want modifications to the whole plugin to be kept under the GPL, and that is why I am splitting the licensing like this.

In summary: Feel free to copy ItemStringInterpreter.java without worrying about the licensing of your plugin. (Just remember to release your modified version - I say this as I doubt it will be useful to anyone without minor modifications.)

## For the plugin as a whole
For the licensing of the entirety of the plugin, except ItemStringInterpreter.java, see [GPL.md](GPL.md).
